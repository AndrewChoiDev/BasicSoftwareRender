# BasicSoftwareRender
This is a basic 3D renderer that utilizes scanline rasterization.
As of December 2020, the renderer only supports obj files that have UV texture coordinates.
Perspective correct texture mapping is applied to the textured model.
Currently, there is no z-buffering, clipping, or lighting.
